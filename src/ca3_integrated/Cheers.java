// Dylan Geraghty - CA3 (Integrated CA) - Programming: Object-Oriented Approach

// NOTE: CHEERS
// ------------------
// THANKS FOR THE CLASSES THIS YEAR!
// Great module and teacher (absolutely no agenda with the praise, just complete sincerity and truth here).
// More time would be needed to really get to grips with all concepts, but Sam covered as much as humanly possible within the limitations given.
// Learned a huge amount about Java in a fairly tiny number of months. A lot of effort was put in to make it more fun and engaging and challenging too.
// Programming is not easy to teach. Lecturers who enjoy the subject and try their best to spread that enjoyment are golden.
// Have a good one with the next class and take care.
